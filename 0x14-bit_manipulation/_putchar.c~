/**
 * _putchar - Writes the character 'c' to standard output (stdout).
 * @c: The character to be printed.
 *
 * Description: This function takes a single character and writes it to
 * standard output. It is a wrapper around the 'write' system call which
 * is used to handle low-level I/O operations in Unix-like systems.
 * 
 * Return: On successful writing, the function returns 1.
 * If an error occurs, the function returns -1, and the global variable
 * 'errno' is set to indicate the error.
